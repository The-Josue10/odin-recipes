Hello, this is my first HTML project which consists on creating a "recipes" website using HTML. This site should properly show the correct use of HTML tags and functions so the information provided can be presented in logical order and the links should properly redirect on a new tab without affecting the main page (index). Addtionaly, the images presented should display correctly and include their ALT information.
