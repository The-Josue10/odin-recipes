This delightful dish is a staple in El Salvador, cherished for its simplicity and soul-satisfying flavors. Whether you’re a seasoned cook or a curious food enthusiast, preparing Yuca Frita at home brings a piece of Salvadoran culture to your dining table.

            <li><em>A pinch of salt to taste.</em></li>

            <li><em>1/4 cup water</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 teaspoon salt</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</em></li>
            <li><em>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the Salsa Roja (Salvadoran red sauce):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><em>1 can (8 oz) of tomato sauce</em></li>
            <li><em>1 cup water</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 onion, chopped</em></li>
            <li><em>1 clove garlic, minced</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</em></li>

            <li><em>1-2 tablespoons oil for cooking</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Prepare the Yuca</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by peeling the yuca, carefully removing the brown outer skin and the waxy layer underneath. If you’re using frozen yuca, this step is already done for you.</li>
            <li>Cut the yuca into 3-4 inch sections. Split each section in half lengthwise and remove the fibrous core.</li>
            <li>Rinse the yuca pieces under cold water.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring the water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the yuca pieces into the boiling water. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the yuca is fork-tender but still firm.</li>
            <li>Drain the yuca and let it cool down slightly. Cut into smaller, bite-sized pieces if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Fry the Yuca:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high heat. You’ll want the oil to be about an inch deep, enough to cover half of the yuca pieces.</li>
            <li>Carefully add the yuca to the hot oil and fry until they are golden brown and crispy, usually about 4-5 minutes on each side. Work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
            <li>Once the yuca is nicely browned and crispy, remove it with a slotted spoon and place it on paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>with a sprinkle of salt while still hot.</li>
            <li>Season with a sprinkle of salt while still hot.</li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Make the Curtido (optional):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the shredded Cabbage, grated carrot, and sliced onion in a bowl.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together apple cider vinegar, water, salt, oregano, and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Pour the vinegar mixture over the cabbage mix and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Let the Curtido sit at room temperature for at least an hour or, even better, refrigerate for several hours to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Prepare the Salsa Roja (optional):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Sauté the onions until translucent, then add garlic and cook for about a minute more.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato sauce, water, and oregano to the pan—season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10-15 minutes to thicken slightly and develop the flavors.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.</li>
        </ol>
